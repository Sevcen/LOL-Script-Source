# LeagueSharp.Common

The LeagueSharp platform, common library is our main support library for all assemblies, containing code which are part of a system or sort of system, required or commonly used data, supporting interfaces designed to assist assemblies which make use of the platform scope. It is made by the whole community to allow a universal standard.

## Getting Started

When starting development with our library, we recommend to overview some of our existing code, examples are available on the forums.
Additionally, you're able to dig into the files and start reading how to code operates, most of the codes are self-explanatory with proper field/property/function names but documentation is available.

## License

Works that are created for use on joduska.me or other PlaySharp affiliated sites can freely use this project.

If you contribute to this library you assign licensing use to us.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning.
